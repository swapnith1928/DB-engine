# 🗃️ Custom DB Engine

This is a lightweight, file-based database engine written in C++. It parses SQL-like commands using a custom-built lexer and parser, and supports basic storage and query operations using a flat file-based backend.

## ✅ Features

- ✅ Custom lexer and parser for SQL-like commands
- ✅ File-based storage engine with support for:
  - Table creation
  - Record insertion
  - Record updation
  - Record deletion
  - Data retrieval (SELECT)
- ✅ Modular architecture separating frontend and backend logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swapnith1928/DB-engine.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd "DB engine"
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o db_engine
./db_engine
```


## 📝 Sample Syntax

You can refer to `syntax.txt` for supported commands and examples.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- 🔍 **B-Tree Indexing**: Replace or complement the current linear search with B-Tree-based indexing for efficient query execution and record lookup.
- 🧠 **Query Optimization**: Implement a query planner and optimizer for better performance on complex queries.
- 🔒 **Transactions & Concurrency**: Support for ACID properties using locking or MVCC.
- 📄 **Persistence Format**: Shift to a binary format with headers and page management for better disk usage.
- 📚 **Support for More SQL Features**: Add AND/OR for conditons in WHERE clauses, JOINs, aggregate functions, etc.
